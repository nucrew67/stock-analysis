# Analysis -Stocks
•	Overview of Project

Steve, a financial expert, requires assistance with his stock market study. Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), an amazing data analysis tool that employs Excel formulas for calculations, is one way I'll use. To reduce errors and save time when running analyses, a VBA code must be built to automate the activities. To examine the list of stocks and report the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock, a worksheet was created. A script was used to compute how long the code would execute and display the time in a text box on the new stock worksheet, which exhibited various returns. Steve will be able to do the analysis on his computer whenever he wants with this new stock worksheet.

•	The purpose 
o	Steve wants to broaden the scope of the dataset to encompass the entire stock market over the last few years. As a result, the goal of this project is to rewrite the code to analyze a large dataset in a reasonable length of time. To output the total volume and yearly return, the refactored function will loop through all the data only once.

•	Results
	The execution time of the original script for the 2017 dataset was 0.929s and for the 2018 dataset was 0.917s as seen below.
 

•	The refactored script execution time for the 2017 data set was 0.410s and for the 2018 dataset was 0.078s as seen below.
 
 

•	In both scenarios, the initial 2017 & 2018 datasets took a little longer to run. In analyzing the same dataset, the refactored data scripts showed execution times less than the original script time scripts, thus indicating that refactoring data script sets will improve both overall speed and efficiency.
•	Summary

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactored code?

The advantages of refactoring code are obtaining improved speed, code that requires less memory, less steps, and overall code readability. The disadvantages of refactoring code might be investing more time and money having to rewrite the code.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The pros of refactoring the original VBA script have shown improved faster runtimes and more efficient dataset coding. The cons of refactoring the original VBA script would be the time invested in rewriting the code.
